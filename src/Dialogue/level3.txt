Hello there! Welcome back home! It's good to see you again.

You know, I'm a bit of a detective, and I noticed that some of your appliances might still be running.

Don't ask me how I know, I just have a hunch. But don't worry, I'm here to help you save the environment and some money too!
turtle
Are you ready to turn off those appliances?
player
Yes, let's do it! Which appliances do I need to turn off?
turtle
Well, each appliance that needs to be turned off will have a bubble with an exclamation mark on it.

When you click on it, you'll be taken to a mini-game.

Don't worry, I'll explain how to play each one before it starts. Complete all of the mini-games to clear this level.
