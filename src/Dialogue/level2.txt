Hello hello! Are you ready for some recycling fun? It's my favorite game!

Look up in the sky - a bunch of items are falling from above!

But don't worry, I have just the thing to catch them. Here, take this recycling bin.

Your job is to catch as many recyclable items as you can. Got it?
player
Got it! What items can I catch?
goose
Well, you can catch the plastic bottles, tin cans, glass jars, and cardboard boxes.
goose
Those are all recyclable items that we can reuse to make new things.

But be careful! Some items are not recyclable, so you want to avoid those. You don't want to contaminate the recycling process.
goose
So, avoid the plastic bags, pots and pans, light bulbs, and ceramic dishware. Those items cannot be recycled.

Good luck!

Remember, the more recyclable items you catch, the better it is for our environment.
